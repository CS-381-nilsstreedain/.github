## Course Policies
### Makeup Exams
Makeup exams take a considerable effort to schedule, so they will not be given under normal circumstances. Any requests for makeup exams must occur in the first week of classes to be considered.

### Incompletes
I will only consider giving an incomplete grade for emergency cases such as a death in the family, major disease, or child birth, while also having a passing grade. If you have a situation that may prevent you from completing the coursework, let me know as soon as you can.
  
## Grading
Scores for coursework items will be posted on Canvas as they are graded. Feedback will be provided when available. You will turn in all coursework items through Canvas and/or TEACH **before** 23:59 (**TEACH server time, Pacific Time Zone**) on the date they are due, be sure you give yourself an hour or more to submit coursework.

### Grade Evaluation
Your course grade will be based on the following:
Assignment | Percentage
---|---
Homework | 50%
Quizzes | 30%
Final Exam | 20%
TOTAL | 100%

### Homework
There are seven homework assignments. Assignments will submitted to Canvas
- Homework submitted up to 24 hours late will receive a 10% penalty.
- Homework submitted from 24 to 48 hours late will receive a 20% penalty.
- Any **disagreement in scoring** must be addressed within one week of the work being
graded. All questions about grading must be placed in the “Assignment Comments” section of the Canvas submission for that assignment. If a response to your comment is not posted within 48 hours you can email a TA requesting that they review the comments.

### Quizzes
There are seven quizzes for this course, Quizzes administered in Canvas and contain multiple choice. True/False, matching and fill in the blank questions. Each quiz attempt has a 90 minute time limit and is not proctored. You will get two attempts at each quiz and your highest score is kept. Some quizzes contain randomly selected question so you may receive different questions on each attempt at the quiz. Quizzes are open book. Late quizzes are not allowed.

### Final Exam
The cumulative final exam will be given in class during finals week at the time scheduled for this
class, Wednesday June 14th at 9:30am

### Grading Scale

* REMINDER: A passing grade for core classes in CS is a C or above. A C-, 72 or below, is not a passing grade for CS majors.
### Attendance
Be respectful of your classmates’ right to learn and my right to teach by following these rules:
- Class attendance is not required, but it is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.
- There will be ungraded in-class activities (ICAs) that will help with Homework assignments.
